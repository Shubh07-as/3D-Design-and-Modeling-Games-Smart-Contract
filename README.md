# 3D Design and Modeling Games Smart Contract

## Project Description
This smart contract is designed to support a decentralized marketplace for 3D design and modeling games. It allows creators to upload and sell their games, while enabling buyers to purchase games directly from the creators. The contract ensures secure and transparent transactions, making it easier for independent developers to monetize their work.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a platform where creators of 3D design and modeling games can showcase and sell their creations. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform provides a fair and transparent environment for creators and buyers. Our goal is to empower developers, artists, and designers to thrive in a decentralized ecosystem without intermediaries.

## Key Features
- **Game Creation**: Developers can list their 3D design and modeling games with a name, description, and price.
- **Secure Payments**: Buyers can purchase games securely using cryptocurrency, with payments directly transferred to the creator.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability and trust.
- **Ownership Management**: Once a game is purchased, it is marked as unavailable, preventing duplicate purchases.
- **Admin Controls**: The contract owner can withdraw unused funds from the contract balance.
- **Open and Decentralized**: No intermediaries are involved, fostering a fair and open marketplace for all participants.

The future improvements for your Solidity code are outlined in the "Future Improvements" section of your document. Here's a summary:

### Potential Enhancements for Your Code
1. **Game Ownership Tracking**:
   - Track buyers and the games they own using a mapping.

2. **Resale Marketplace**:
   - Enable users to resell purchased games, benefiting both buyers and original creators.

3. **Royalty System**:
   - Allow creators to earn a percentage of resale transactions.

4. **Game Reviews and Ratings**:
   - Provide a system for users to review and rate games.

5. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   - Let creators adjust game prices before any purchases are made.

6. **Bundled Purchases**:
   - Allow the sale of game bundles at a discount.
